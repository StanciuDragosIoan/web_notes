  <h1 class="header">Oauth2</h1>
  <p class="text">
    <span class="snippet">OAuth 2.0</span> is the industry-standard protocol for authorization.
    <br />
    <span class="snippet">OAuth 2.0</span> focuses on client developer simplicity while providing specific authorization
    flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    <span class="snippet">OAuth2.0</span> is a delegated authorisation framework. This means it allows application A to
    access resources hosted by application B on behalf of a resource owner.

    What is OAuth2?
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    <span class="snippet">OAuth2.0</span> is a delegated authorisation framework. This means it allows application A to
    access resources hosted by application B on behalf of a resource owner.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Let's imagine we have a basic application, <span class="snippet">'Example App'</span>. Example App (application A)
    would like to access some of a
    user's (resource owner's) information currently hosted on <span class="snippet">Google</span> (application B). A
    screen showing Example App
    requesting access to the information Google holds on the user is below:
  </p>
  <div class="devPic">
    <img src="./img/google.png" alt="">
  </div>

  <p class="text">
    The user grants Example App access to some of their information they stored in Google (in this case their basic
    profile info and email address). However, how does Example App retrieve this information, and how does Google know
    to allow Example App access? This is the role of OAuth2.0.
  </p>

  <p class="text center">
    Key concepts:
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Authentication:
    <br />
    Making sure you are who you say you are.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    Authorisation:
    <br />
    Making sure you are only allowed to do what you're supposed to.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    <span class="snippet"> OAuth2.0</span> is a framework for <span class="snippet">authorisation</span> and <span
      class="snippet">not
      authentication</span>. It allows an
    application (Example App) access to
    resources (basic profile info and email address) hosted by another application (Google). Google might handle the
    authentication component, but this is outside OAuth2.0.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Therefore, <span class="snippet">OAuth2.0 </span> cares about what you can do, but not who you are.
  </p>

  <p class="text center bold">
    Basic OAuth2.0
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    To introduce the main components of the framework, let's employ a popular analogy: visiting a hotel.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    We (the <span class="snippet">client</span>) are visiting a hotel (so we request access to <span
      class="snippet">hotel resources</span> and the
    hotel is their <span class="snippet">'owner'</span>).
    <br />
    We go to the front desk (this is the <span class="snippet">authorization server</span> responsible for giving access
    to resources)
    and it gives us a key card (this is an <span class="snippet">access token</span> a resource that the resource server
    will check to see if we can access certain resources or not).
    <br />
    With the key from the front desk we can access the hotel's gym, sauna or bar (these are <span class="snippet">the
      server resources</span>).
    <br />
    The resources will also have <span class="snippet">scopes</span> of access (saying what we can and cannot do with
    the resource) for instance we can order a drink at the bar but not sleep on it.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    The order in which we do these teps is known as <span class="snippet">grant type/flows</span> and the picture below
    illustrates it:
