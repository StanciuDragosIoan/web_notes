      OpenSSL is a versatile command line tool that can be used for a large
      variety of tasks related to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and HTTPS
      (HTTP over TLS).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a technology for authenticating users
      and devices in the digital world. The basic idea is to have one or more
      trusted parties digitally sign documents certifying that a particular
      cryptographic key belongs to a particular user or device. The key can then
      be used as an identity for the user in digital networks.

      Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs)
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      If you would like to obtain an SSL certificate from a certificate
      authority (CA), you must generate a certificate signing request (CSR). A
      CSR consists mainly of the public key of a key pair, and some additional
      information. Both of these components are inserted into the certificate
      when it is signed.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Whenever you generate a CSR, you will be prompted to provide information
      regarding the certificate. This information is known as a Distinguised
      Name (DN). An important field in the DN is the Common Name (CN), which
      should be the exact Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the host that
      you intend to use the certificate with. It is also possible to skip the
      interactive prompts when creating a CSR by passing the information via
      command line or from a file.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The other items in a DN provide additional information about your business
      or organization. If you are purchasing an SSL certificate from a
      certificate authority, it is often required that these additional fields,
      such as “Organization”, accurately reflect your organization’s details.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      A CSR information prompt would look like this:
    </p>
    <div class="devPic">
      <img src="./img/csr.png" alt="" />
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      If you want to non-interactively answer the CSR information prompt, you
      can do so by adding the -subj option to any OpenSSL commands that request
      CSR information. Here is an example of the option, using the same
      information displayed in the code block above:
    </p>
    <div class="devPic">
      <img src="./img/open_ssl_cli.png" alt="" />
    </div>
    <p class="text center bold">
      Generating a CSR
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      CSRs can be used to request SSL certificates from a certificate authority.
      We may add the CSR information non-interactively with the -subj option.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">
      Generate a Private Key and a CSR
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Use this method if you want to use HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) to secure your
      Apache HTTP or Nginx web server, and you want to use a Certificate
      Authority (CA) to issue the SSL certificate. The CSR that is generated can
      be sent to a CA to request the issuance of a CA-signed SSL certificate. If
      your CA supports SHA-2, add the -sha256 option to sign the CSR with SHA-2.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      This command creates a 2048-bit private key (domain.key) and a CSR
      (domain.csr) from scratch:
    </p>
    <!-- 
      sudo openssl req \
       -key ~/.ssh/id_rsa
       -new -out test.csr

       openssl req -new -key ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out request.csr

       amaimon-ROG-Strix-G731GV-G731GV

       penssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout amaimon-ROG-Strix-G731GV-G731GV
.key -out mydomain.csr
