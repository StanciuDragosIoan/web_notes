  <p class="text">
    In the ever-accelerating realm of software development, where speed and responsiveness are paramount, the quest for
    efficient I/O operations becomes a defining challenge. The contrast between lightning-fast in-memory computations,
    measured in nanoseconds, and the sluggishness of disk or network access, clocking in at milliseconds, is a constant
    source of concern. Traditional blocking I/O exacerbates this issue, as each operation pauses the program’s execution
    until completion, leading to potential bottlenecks and diminished performance.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    In this pursuit of unlocking unprecedented efficiency, the Reactor design pattern emerges as a beacon of hope. This
    formidable pattern lies at the very core of Node.js, propelling it into the forefront of asynchronous excellence. At
    its heart, the Reactor pattern embraces non-blocking I/O, a paradigm shift where system calls return immediately,
    freeing threads to perform other tasks while they await data. This fundamental departure from traditional blocking
    I/O marks a pivotal moment in how Node.js handles concurrent connections and I/O operations, making it a platform of
    choice for building highly responsive, scalable applications.

    Blocking I/O vs. Non-Blocking I/O :
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    In the traditional blocking I/O model, each operation halts program execution until completion, potentially leading
    to delays and performance issues. In contrast, non-blocking I/O allows system calls to return immediately,
    empowering threads to perform other tasks while awaiting data. This paradigm shift enhances resource utilization,
    concurrency, and responsiveness in Node.js applications.

    How concurrency be handled in a single-threaded
    application ?

  </p>

  <p class="text">
    In a single-threaded application, handling concurrency effectively is achieved through a synchronous event
    demultiplexer or event notification interface. This mechanism allows the application to efficiently manage multiple
    non-blocking resources without resorting to inefficient busy-waiting techniques.
  </p>

  <p class="text center bold">
    Here's how the process unfolds:

    <br>
    1. Resources, such as sockets or pipes, are added to a data structure along with their associated operations, e.g.,
    read operations.

    <br>

    2. The event notifier is set up with the group of resources to be watched. It blocks the flow until any of the
    watched resources is ready for a read. When an event occurs, the event demultiplexer returns, providing a set of
    events to be processed.

    <br>

    3. Each event returned by the event demultiplexer is processed without blocking, as the resources are guaranteed to
    be ready to read. If a resource is closed, it is removed from the watched list. Otherwise, the data received is
    processed accordingly.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    By employing this pattern, a single thread can efficiently handle multiple I/O operations concurrently without
    resorting to busy-waiting. The event loop ensures that tasks are spread over time, minimizing idle time for the
    thread.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    This single-threaded concurrency approach in Node.js has multiple benefits. It simplifies concurrency strategies and
    eliminates in-process race conditions and the complexities associated with managing multiple threads. The absence of
    these complications allows developers to focus on writing more straightforward and robust code, ultimately leading
    to a more efficient and scalable application.

  <p class="text center bold">
    The reactor pattern
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    The reactor pattern is an advanced design approach that builds upon the concepts discussed in the preceding section.
    At its core, the pattern revolves around the concept of a handler, represented in Node.js as a callback function,
    being linked to each input/output (I/O) operation. The fundamental idea is to efficiently handle events by
    associating a dedicated callback function with them, which promptly executes when an event is generated and
    subsequently processed by the event loop. This structure allows for non-blocking and asynchronous handling of I/O
    operations, making it well-suited for high-performance applications that rely heavily on event-driven programming
    paradigms. By utilizing the reactor pattern, developers can create more responsive and scalable systems that
    effectively utilize system resources and optimize the handling of concurrent events.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p class="text">
    In an application utilizing the reactor pattern, the process of handling I/O operations follows a well-defined
    sequence of steps:
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    <br>
    1. Application Initiates I/O: The application initiates a new I/O operation by submitting a request to the Event
    Demultiplexer. Along with the request, the application also specifies a corresponding handler function, which will
    be executed when the operation is completed. It’s important to note that this request submission is a non-blocking
    call, meaning that the application continues its execution without waiting for the operation to finish.

    <br>
    2. Event Demultiplexer and Event Queue: The Event Demultiplexer is responsible for monitoring and managing multiple
    I/O operations. When a set of I/O operations is completed, the Event Demultiplexer forwards the resulting events to
    the Event Queue.


    <br>
    3. Event Loop Iteration: The Event Loop enters the picture at this point and starts iterating over the items in the
    Event Queue.

    <br>

    4. Handler Invocation: For each event in the Event Queue, the associated handler function is invoked. The handler
    function is a part of the application code and performs specific tasks related to the completed I/O operation. The
    execution of the handler function may involve additional asynchronous operations.

    <br>

    5. Asynchronous Flow: During the execution of the handler function, it can delegate new asynchronous operations. In
    this case, the application submits new requests to the Event Demultiplexer before the control is returned to the
    Event Loop. This process continues recursively, enabling a smooth flow of asynchronous operations within the
    application.

    <br>

    6. Event Loop Continuation: Once all items in the Event Queue are processed, the Event Loop returns to blocking
    mode, waiting for new events to arrive from the Event Demultiplexer.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    The asynchronous nature of the reactor pattern is evident in the way the application expresses its interest in
    accessing resources without blocking. Instead, it provides handlers that are executed at a later point in time when
    the corresponding I/O operations are finished.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    In the context of Node.js, this pattern lies at the core of its design philosophy. Node.js efficiently handles I/O
    by blocking only when necessary, maximizing resource utilization, and responding to events in a non-blocking and
    asynchronous manner. As pending operations in the Event Demultiplexer are completed and there are no further events
    in the Event Queue, the Node.js application automatically exits.
