      CPU - Central Processing Unit
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The CPU is the brain of the PC (where the actual computing is done). The
      type and family of the CPU have a major influence on our OS (as programs
      are designed to work on specific types of processors).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      In the desktop computer world there are 2 main types of CPU (x86 and
      x86-64). The CPU is inserted in the motherboard.
    </p>
    <p class="text">32-bit and 64-bit processors</p>
    <p class="text">
      The 64-bit processor was released by intel for the first time (it was
      initially designed for servers). The 64 bit architecture is usually
      better/faster.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The 32-bit processor is usually limited to 4GB of ram, while the 62-bit
      one can support more.
