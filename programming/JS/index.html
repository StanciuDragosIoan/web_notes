    <h1 class="header">JS Engine + async code</h1>

    <p class="text">
      JS is a single-threaded language that uses a callback queue.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      JS Being single threaded means it has only one callstack and one memory
      heap.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      It executes code in order and must finish executing a piece code before
      moving onto the next.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      It's synchronous, but at times that can be harmful. For example, if a
      function takes awhile to execute or has to wait on something, it freezes
      everything up in the meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      A good example of this happening is the window alert function:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
        alert("Hello World");
        </pre
    >
    <p class="text">
      You can't interact with the webpage at all until you hit OK and dismiss
      the alert. You're stuck.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The V8 engine and the web APIs allow us to run code asynchronously. The
      engine is built by Google Chrome in C++
    </p>
    <p class="text">Simple code snippet:</p>
    <pre class="code">
      console.log("first");

      setTimeout(() => 
        { console.log("second") }
          , 1000);

      console.log("third")
    </pre>
    <p class="text">output of the code above:</p>
    <pre class="code">
      first
      third
      undefined
      second
    </pre>
    <p class="text">explanation:</p>
    <p class="text">
      <span class="snippet">console.log("first");</span> is on the stack first,
      so it gets printed. Next, the engine notices
      <span class="snippet">setTimeout()</span>, which isn't handled by
      Javascript and pushes it off to the WebAPI to be done asynchronously. The
      call stack moves on without caring about the code handed off to the Web
      APIs and <span class="snippet">console.log("three");</span> is printed.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Next, the Javascript engine's event loop kicks in (once the callstack is
      clear), like a little kid asking "Are we there yet?" on a road trip. It
      starts firing, waiting for events to be pushed into it. Since the
      <span class="snippet">setTimeout()</span> isn't finished, it returns
      undefined, as the default, well because it hasn't been given the value
      yet. Once the callback finally does return (finishes executing) we get
      <span class="snippet">console.log("second");</span> printed.
    </p>
