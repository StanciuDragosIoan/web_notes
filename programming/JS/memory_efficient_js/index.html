    <h1 class="header">Memory Efficient JS</h1>

    <p class="text">
        <span class="snippet">JavaScript engines</span> such as Google's V8 (Chrome, Node) are specifically <span
            class="snippet">designed</span> for
        the fast execution of large
        JavaScript applications.
        <br /> As you develop, if you care about memory usage and performance, you should be aware of
        some of what's going on in your user's browser's JavaScript engine behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        Whether it's <span class="snippet">V8</span>, <span class="snippet">SpiderMonkey</span> (Firefox), <span
            class="snippet">Carakan</span>
        (Opera), <span class="snippet">Chakra</span> (IE) or something
        else, doing so can help you
        better optimize your applications. That's not to say one should optimize for a single browser or engine. Never
        do that.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Questions we should ask ourselves about our code:
        <br />
        . Is there anything I could be doing more efficiently in my code?
        <br />
        . What (common) optimizations do popular JavaScript engines make?
        <br />
        . What is the engine unable to optimize for, and is the garbage collector able to clean up what I’m expecting it
        to?

    </p>

    <p class="text center bold">
        So, How Does <span class="snippet">JavaScript</span> Work In <span class="snippet">V8</span>?
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        <span class="snippet">V8</span> is made of a few core pieces:
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        * A <span class="snippet">base compiler</span>, which <span class="snippet">parses</span> your <span
            class="snippet">JavaScript</span> and
        <span class="snippet">generates native machine code</span>
        before it is executed, rather
        than executing bytecode or simply interpreting it. This code is initially not highly optimized.
        <br> <br>

        * <span class="snippet">V8</span> represents your objects in an <span class="snippet">object model</span>.
        <span class="snippet">Objects</span> are represented as
        <span class="snippet">associative arrays </span> in JavaScript,
        but in <span class="snippet">V8</span> they are represented with <span class="snippet">hidden classes</span>,
        which are an <span class="snippet">internal type
            system for optimized lookups</span>.

        <br> <br>
        * The <span class="snippet">runtime profiler</span> monitors the system being run and <span
            class="snippet">identifies “hot” functions</span>
        (i.e. code that ends up
        spending a long time running).

        <br> <br>
        * An <span class="snippet">optimizing compiler</span> recompiles and <span class="snippet">optimizes</span> the
        <span class="snippet">“hot” code</span> identified by the
        runtime profiler, and <span class="snippet">performs
            optimizations</span> such as inlining (i.e. replacing a function call site with the body of the callee).

        <br> <br>
        *<span class="snippet">V8</span> supports <span class="snippet">deoptimization</span>, meaning the optimizing
        compiler can bail out of code
        generated if it discovers that
        some of the assumptions it made about the optimized code were too optimistic.
        <br> <br>


        * It has a <span class="snippet">garbage collector</span>. Understanding how it works can be just as important
        as the optimized JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p class="text center">Garbage Collection</p>
    <p class="text">
        <span class="snippet"> Garbage collection</span> is a form of <span class="snippet">memory management</span>.
        It's where we have the notion
        of a collector which <span class="snippet">attempts
            to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer being used</span>. In a garbage-collected language
        such as
        JavaScript, <span class="snippet">objects that are still referenced by your application are not cleaned
            up</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        <span class="snippet"> Manually de-referencing </span> objects is <span class="snippet">not necessary</span> in
        most cases.
        <br /> By simply <span class="snippet">putting
            the variables where they need
            to be</span> (ideally, <span class="snippet">as local as possible</span>, i.e. inside the function where
        they are used versus an outer
        scope),
        things should just work.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        It's <span class="snippet">not possible</span> to <span class="snippet">force garbage collection</span> in
        JavaScript. You wouldn't want to
        do this, because the <span class="snippet">garbage
            collection process</span> is <span class="snippet">controlled</span> by the <span
            class="snippet">runtime</span>, and it generally <span class="snippet">knows
            best when things should be
            cleaned up</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="text bold">
        DE-REFERENCING MISCONCEPTIONS
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        In quite a few discussions online about reclaiming memory in JavaScript, the <span class="snippet">delete</span>
        keyword is brought up, as
        although it was <span class="snippet">supposed</span> to be <span class="snippet">used</span> for just <span
            class="snippet">removing
            keys from a map</span>, some
        developers think you can force
        de-referencing using it.
        <br> <span class="snippet">Avoid</span> using <span class="snippet">delete</span> if you can. In the below
        example, <span class="snippet">delete o.x</span> does a lot
        more <span class="snippet">harm</span>
        than good behind the scenes, as it changes o's hidden class and makes it a generic slow object.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
var o = { x: 1 };
delete o.x; // true
o.x; // undefined
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
        That said, you are almost certain to <span class="snippet">find references</span> to <span
            class="snippet">delete</span> in many popular
        JavaScript <span class="snippet">libraries</span> - it does
        have a <span class="snippet">purpose</span> in the language.
        <br />The main <span class="snippet">takeaway</span> here is to <span class="snippet">avoid modifying the
            structure of hot objects at
            runtime</span>.
        <br /><span class="snippet">JavaScript engines</span> can detect such “hot” objects and attempt to optimize
        them. This is
        easier if the
        object's structure doesn't heavily change over its lifetime and delete can trigger such changes.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        There are also misconceptions about how <span class="snippet">null</span> works. Setting an object reference to
        <span class="snippet">null</span> doesn't “null” the
        object. It <span class="snippet">sets</span> the <span class="snippet">object reference</span> to <span
            class="snippet">null</span>. Using
        o.x = null is <span class="snippet">better than using
            delete</span>, but it's probably
        not even necessary.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
var o = { x: 1 };
o = null;
o; // null
o.x // TypeError
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
        If this reference was the <span class="snippet">last reference</span> to the object, the object is then <span
            class="snippet">eligible
            for garbage collection</span>. If
        the reference was not the <span class="snippet">last reference</span> to the object, the object is reachable and
        will <span class="snippet">not</span> be <span class="snippet">garbage
            collected</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Another important note to be aware of is that <span class="snippet">global variables</span> are <span
            class="snippet">not cleaned up
            by the garbage collector</span>
        during the life of your page. Regardless of how long the page is open, <span class="snippet"> variables scoped
        </span><span class="snippet">to</span> the JavaScript
        <span class="snippet">runtime global</span> object will stick around.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
        var myGlobalNamespace = {};
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
        <span class="snippet">Globals</span> are <span class="snippet">cleaned up</span> when you <span
            class="snippet">refresh the page</span>,
        <span class="snippet">navigate</span> to a <span class="snippet">different page</span>,
        <span class="snippet">close tabs</span> or <span class="snippet">exit</span> your browser.
        <span class="snippet">Function-scoped</span> variables get <span class="snippet">cleaned up</span> when a
        <span class="snippet">variable falls out of scope</span>. When
        <span class="snippet">functions have exited</span> and
        there aren't any more references to it, the variable gets <span class="snippet">cleaned up</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="text bold">
        RULES OF THUMB
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        To give the <span class="snippet">garbage collector</span> a <span class="snippet">chance</span> to <span
            class="snippet">collect</span> as
        many objects as possible as
        <span class="snippet">early</span> as possible, don't hold
        on to objects you no longer need. This mostly happens automatically; here are a few things to keep in mind.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        As mentioned earlier, a better <span class="snippet">alternative</span> to <span class="snippet">manual
            de-referencing</span> is to <span class="snippet">use
            variables with an appropriate
            scope</span>. I.e. instead of a global variable that's nulled out, just use a function-local variable that
        goes out of
        scope when it's no longer needed. This means cleaner code with less to worry about.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Ensure that you're <span class="snippet">unbinding event listeners</span> where they are no longer required,
        especially when the DOM objects
        they're bound to are about to be removed.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        If you're using a data cache locally, make sure to clean that cache or use an aging mechanism to avoid large
        chunks of data being stored that you're unlikely to reuse
    </p>
    <p class="text bold">
        FUNCTIONS
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Garbage collection works by reclaiming blocks of memory (objects) which are no longer reachable. To better
        illustrate this, here are some examples.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
        function foo() {
            var bar = new LargeObject();
            bar.someCall();
        }
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
        When <span class="snippet">foo</span> returns, the object which <span class="snippet">bar</span> points to is
        automatically available for
        garbage collection, because
        there is nothing left that has a reference to it.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Compare this to:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
        function foo() {
            var bar = new LargeObject();
            bar.someCall();
            return bar;
        }
        
        // somewhere else
        var b = foo();
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
        We now have a <span class="snippet">reference</span> to the object which <span class="snippet">survives the
            call</span> and persists until
        the caller assigns something
        else to <span class="snippet">b</span> (or <span class="snippet">b</span> goes out of scope).
    </p>
    <p class="text bold">
        CLOSURES:
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        When you see a <span class="snippet">function that returns an inner function</span>, that inner function will
        have access to the outer scope
        even after the outer function is executed. This is basically a closure — an expression which can work with
        variables set within a specific context. For example:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
        function sum (x) {
            function sumIt(y) {
                return x + y;
            };
            return sumIt;
        }
        
        // Usage
        var sumA = sum(4);
        var sumB = sumA(3);
        console.log(sumB); // Returns 7
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
        The function object created within the execution context of the call to <span class="snippet">sum</span> can't
        be garbage collected, as it's
        referenced by a global variable and is still very much accessible. It can still be executed via sumA(n).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Let's look at another example. Here, can we access <span class="snippet">largeStr</span>?
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
        var a = function () {
            var largeStr = new Array(1000000).join('x');
            return function () {
                return largeStr;
            };
        }();
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
        Yes, we can, via <span class="snippet">a()</span>, so it's not collected. How about this one?
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
        var a = function () {
            var smallStr = 'x';
            var largeStr = new Array(1000000).join('x');
            return function (n) {
                return smallStr;
            };
        }();
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
        We can't access it anymore (as it is not returned in the 'returned' function) and it's a candidate for garbage
        collection.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        TIMERS
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        One of the worst places to leak is in a loop, or in <span class="snippet">setTimeout()/setInterval()</span>, but
        this is quite common.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Consider the following example.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
        var myObj = {
            callMeMaybe: function () {
                var myRef = this;
                var val = setTimeout(function () {
                    console.log('Time is running out!');
                    myRef.callMeMaybe();
                }, 1000);
            }
        };
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
        If we then run:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
        myObj.callMeMaybe();
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
        to begin the timer, we can see every second “Time is running out!” If we then run:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
        myObj = null;
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
        The timer will still fire. <span class="snippet">myObj</span> won't be garbage collected as the closure passed
        to <span class="snippet">setTimeout</span> has to be kept
        alive in order to be executed. In turn, it holds references to myObj as it captures <span
            class="snippet">myRef</span>. This would be the
        same if we'd passed the closure to any other function, keeping references to it.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        It is also worth keeping in mind that references inside a <span class="snippet">setTimeout/setInterval</span>
        call, such as functions, will
        need to execute and complete before they can be garbage collected.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Be Aware Of Performance Traps
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        It's important <span class="snippet">never to optimize</span> code until you actually <span
            class="snippet">need</span> to. This can't be
        stressed enough. It's easy to
        see a number of micro-benchmarks showing that N is more optimal than M in <span class="snippet">V8</span>, but
        test it in a real module of
        code or in an actual application, and the true impact of those optimizations may be much more minimal than you
        were expecting.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Let's say we want to create a module which:

    <p class="text">
        In this case however, the only <span class="snippet">data</span> we're iterating are <span

        able to

        be sure.

        In our case, adding in these changes results in some good (expected) performance gains. Event delegation

        We might then look to other ways of improving performance. You may have read somewhere that using the prototypal
        pattern is more optimal than the module pattern (we confirmed it wasn't earlier), or heard that using JavaScript
        templating frameworks are highly optimized. Sometimes they are, but use them because they make for readable
        code. Also, precompile!. Let's test and find out how true this hold in practice.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
moduleG = function () {};

moduleG.prototype.data = dataArray;
moduleG.prototype.init = function () {
    this.addTable();
    this.addEvents();
};
moduleG.prototype.addTable = function () {
    var template = _.template($('#template').text());
    var html = template({'data' : this.data});
    $tbody.append(html);
};
moduleG.prototype.addEvents = function () {
   $('table').on('click', 'td', function () {
       $(this).toggleClass('active');
   });
};

var modG = new moduleG();

        As it turns out, in this case the performance benefits are negligible. Opting for <span
            class="snippet">templating</span> and <span class="snippet">prototypes</span>
        didn't really offer anything more than what we had before. That said, performance isn't really the reason modern
        developers use either of these things — it's the readability, inheritance model and maintainability they bring
        to your codebase.

        V8 Optimization Tips

        Certain patterns will cause <span class="snippet">V8</span> to bail out of optimizations. A <span
            class="snippet">try-catch</span>, for

        If you care about speed, try very hard to keep your functions <span class="snippet">monomorphic</span>, i.e.
        make sure that variables
        (including properties, arrays and function parameters) only ever contain objects with the same hidden class. For
        example, don't do this:
