    <p class="text center bold">JS Engine</p>
    <p class="text">
      The V8 Engine is probably the most well known JS engine. It was built by
      Google Chrome in C++. It was first released in 2008 (Google needed a
      better JS engine for their Google Maps Application). The engine takes JS
      code and converts it to machine code.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Besides the V8 Engine, there are multiple other JavaScript Engines. The
      SpiderMonkey engine was the first engine ever. It was built by Brendan
      Eich (the creator of the JS language). Other examples of JS engines
      include: Chakra.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">How does the egnine work?</p>
    <p class="text">
      The engine instructs the computer to execute the JS code. The code is
      initially broken into tokens by the parser, next it is converted into AST
      (Abstract Syntax Tree). See the fllowing
      <a href="https://astexplorer.net/" target="_blank"> Link</a> for more info
      on AST. Once it became an AST, the code runs through an interpreter
      (compiler/profiler) which turns it int bytecode - code that CPU can
      understand and run.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      At a very simple level, a JS engine can work like the below function:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
      //logs an array of the code body 
      function jsengine(code) {
        return code.split(/\s+/);
      }
      
      //[ 'var', 'a', '=', '5' ]
      console.log(jsengine("var a = 5")); 
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      However do not forget that although anyone can write a JS engine, they all
      must adhere to the ECMAScript standard.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">Interpreters and Compilers</p>
    <p class="text">
      In programming there are 2 ways to translate code into
      machine-understandable language (machine code): the interpreter and the
      compiler.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The interpreter translates and reads the code files (line by line at
      runtime 'on the fly').
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The compiler does not read/translate the code at runtime. It works ahead
      of time, reads all the code and translates it into a language that can be
      understood by the CPU.
