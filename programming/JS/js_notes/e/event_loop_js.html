    <h1 class="header">JS Event Loop</h1>
    <p class="text">
      JS is a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous, concurrent language.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      It has a call stack, an event loop, a callback queue and some APIs (web
      APIs or Node JS APIs) to perform background tasks such as network request.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">the V8 Engine:</p>
    <div class="devPic">
      <img src="../../img/v8.png" alt="v8 engine pic" />
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      It has a single call stack and a single memory heap. In the call stack it
      executes the functions in stack frames (each function has its own frame)
      and it also holds the execution contexts of the functions. In the heap it
      allocates and frees up memory.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The V8 engine does not have the Web APIs like setTimeout, DOM,
      ajax/hmlXttp request APIs. (these are web APIs available in the browser or
      in node JS).
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">Bigger picture:</p>
    <div class="devPic">
      <img src="../../img/bigPic.png" alt="v8 engine + web APIs pic" />
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      Apart from the V8 Runtime and the Web APIs, we also have an event loop and
      a callback queue available in the browser/in node JS.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">The call stack</p>
    <p class="text">
      JS is single threaded so it can only do 1 thing at a time (it has a single
      thread and a single call stack).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The call stack is a data structure that records where in the program we
      are (at runtime). If we step into a function, we put it onto the stack, if
      we return from a function we pop it off the stack. The stack also has a
      Last In First Out order of execution so the last function put onto the
      stack will be the first one to be executed.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">Code snippet:</p>
    <pre class="code">
      function multiply(a, b){
        return a * b;
      }

      function square(n) {
        return multiply(n, n);
      }

      function printSquare(n){
        var squared = square(n);
        console.log(squared);
      }

      printSquare(4);
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      The code snippet above will call a
      <span class="snippet">main();</span> function (which is implicit like the
      file itself being executed)has some function definitions and then it will
      call <span class="snippet">printSquare();</span> and push it onto the
      stack.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Inside <span class="snippet">printSquare()</span> it will call
      <span class="snippet">square();</span> and push it onto the stack.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Inside <span class="snippet">square();</span> it will call
      <span class="snippet">multiply();</span> and push it onto the stack.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Inside <span class="snippet">multiply();</span> it will return so it will
      push it off the stack (note the last one to pe pushed onto the stack was
      the first function to be executed and popped off the stack).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Next it will return from <span class="snippet">square();</span> and it
      will push it off the stack.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Next it will allocate <span class="snippet">squared</span> variable, it
      will push <span class="snippet">console.log();</span> onto the stack, log
      the variable <span class="snippet">squared</span>, pop the
      <span class="snippet">console.log();</span> off the stack and finally pop
      <span class="snippet">printSquare();</span> off the stack.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">a visual representation of the stack:</p>
    <div class="devPic">
      <img src="../../img/callstack.png" alt="call stack" />
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      After calling <span class="snippet">multiply();</span> and
      <span class="snippet">square();</span> the script will pop them off the
      stack, it will put the<span class="snippet">console.log();</span> call
      onto the stack, execute it, pop it off the stack and finally pop the
      <span class="snippet">printSquare();</span> call off the stack.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      We even get the stack trace (the state of the stack when the error
      happened) printed in case of an error. If we run the code below in a
      browser:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
      function foo() {
        throw new Error("Oops!");
      }

      function bar() {
        foo();
      }

      function baz() {
        bar();
      }

      baz();
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      we get printed a visual representation of the stack at the moment when the
      error was thrown:
    </p>
    <div class="devPic">
      <img src="../../img/error.png" alt="error and stack trace" />
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      <span class="snippet">baz()</span> which was called by this
      <span class="snippet">&lt;anonymous&gt;</span> function (our
      <span class="snippet">main()</span>
      function in the picture above with the call stack) called
      <span class="snippet">bar()</span> which called
      <span class="snippet">foo()</span> which threw and error.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">Stack overflow (or blowing the stack):</p>
    <pre class="code">
      function foo(){
        return foo();
      }

      foo();
    </pre>
    <p class="text center">
      If we run the code above, we get the following error:
    </p>
    <div class="devPic">
      <img src="../../img/stackoverflow.png" alt="stackoverflow" />
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      A function which calls itself recursively without a breaking condition
      will cause a stack overflow (eat up all the memory available) and chrome
      kills this case with this error (note how all the
      <span class="snippet">foo()</span> calls are made by the
      <span class="snippet">&lt;anonymous&gt;</span> main function).
    </p>

    <p class="text center bold">Blocking (when things are slow)</p>
    <p class="text">
      Blocking code is code that is slow (for instance a synchronous network
      request) and blocks the stack (because it is onto it and all the other
      code has to wait for it to execute). Another example is the
      <span class="snippet">alert();</span> call which blocks the browser (and
      the stack) until the user dismisses the alert.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
      //synchronous network requests
      let foo = getSyncFile1(); //wait till request finishes
      let bar = getSyncFile2(); //same..
      let baz = getSyncFile3(); // ...

      console.log(foo);
      console.log(bar);
      console.log(baz);
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      If we run the code above, each network request would block the stack until
      it finishes (each request would be put onto the stack, then the script
      waits for it to finish, then the next request is pushed onto the stack,
      then the script waits for it to finish too, etc... and only after the 3
      requests are completed we can push the 3 console logs onto the stack and
      clear it).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      This is how a single threaded synchronous programming language works and
      if we ran the code above in a browser, we would notice that because the
      requests are made synchronously, while a request is going on, everything
      else freezes (buttons/UI).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      A sollution for this problem would be to use asynchronous calls through
      callback functions for the network requests instead of synchronous ones.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">Async Callbacks and the Call Stack</p>
    <pre class="code">
      console.log("hi");

      setTimeout(function cb() {
        console.log("there");
      }, 5000);

      console.log("JSConfEU");
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      When the code above is executed, the first
      <span class="snippet">console.log("hi");</span> is pushed onto the stack,
      executed and popped off then the
      <span class="snippet">setTimeout();</span> is called (pushed onto the
      stack, then popped off), next the second
      <span class="snippet">console.log("JSConfEU");</span> is pushed onto the
      stack, executed and popped off, and finally after 5 seconds the
      <span class="snippet">console.log("there");</span> is pushed onto the
      stack, executed and popped off.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The 5 seconds count demanded by the
      <span class="snippet">setTimeout();</span> call was handled by a web API
      (the setTimeout web API), once the web API finished, the last
      <span class="snippet">console.log("there")</span> was pushed onto the
      stack.
    </p>
    <p class="text">So the output of the code above would be:</p>
    <pre class="code">
        hi
        JSConfEU
        there //after 5 seconds
    </pre>
    <p class="text center bold">Concurrency & The Event Loop</p>
    <p class="text">
      Besides the runtime (V8 engine) the browser also gives us these web APIs
      (node JS has them too implemented in C++) like setTimeout, which are like
      separate threads which we can use to perform concurrent actions.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      In the code snippet above, the 5 seconds counting was handled by the
      setTimeout web API, once it finished, it passed the callback function (cb)
      to the callback queue (also known as the task queue). The
      <span class="bold">Event Loop</span>
      checks continuously if the stack is empty and if there is a function in
      the callback queue, waiting to be executed. And in this case it handles
      the
      <span class="snippet">cb()</span>
      call to the stack. If there are more callback functions in the queue, it
      handles them one by one to the stack, starting with the first.
    </p>
    <div class="devPic">
      <img src="../../img/eventloop.gif" alt="event loop" />
    </div>
    <p class="text center">code snippet:</p>
    <pre class="code">
      setTimeout(function timeout(){
        console.log("hi");
      }, 1000);

      setTimeout(function timeout(){
        console.log("hi");
      }, 1000);

      setTimeout(function timeout(){
        console.log("hi");
      }, 1000);

      setTimeout(function timeout(){
        console.log("hi");
      }, 1000);
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      If we run the snippet above, all the console logs will show in roughly 1
      second but the event loop will queue all of the callbacks first and then
      execute them in order.
      <span class="snippet">SetTimeout()</span>
      guarantees a minimal delay until the execution (1 second in this case).
      Just like when running <span class="snippet">setTimeout()</span> with a 0
      countdown, it will still delay the execution.

    <p class="text center bold">Callbacks</p>
    <p class="text">
      Callbacks can be any function that another function calls (synchronous
      callbacks), or they can be asynchronous callbacks that are pushed onto the
      callback queue.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
      //callback ran in the same callstack
      [1,3,2,4].forEach(function(i){
        console.log(i);
      });

      //async callback (with an 'async' forEach)
      function asyncForEach(array, cb){
        array.forEach(function(){
          setTimeout(cb, 0);
        });
      }

      asyncForEach([1,2,3,4], function(i){
        console.log(i);
      });
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      The asynchronous way is better and much faster (if we were to do some
      complex/long processing on the array items that benefit would be obvious).
      The synchronous way is not that good because it blocks the stack
      (everything else freezes while the current function execution is running).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      There is also the problem of browser re-rendering. The browser wants to
      repaind everything as fast as possible (60 frames/second ideally). If we
      process stuff synchronously, the browser freezes too and it cannot
      re-render things, user can't select text, no interaction is available
      because the renderer is blocked. On the other hand asynchronous callbacks
      have a lower priority than the browser re-rendering, so the render is
      blocked only while we queue the callback functions, but in between these
      callbacks it can re-redner everything (this is a huge performance
      benefit).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Synchronous slow code blocks the stack (and the browser rendering process)
      which slows the UI (freezes it up). For instance a scroll event takes a
      heavy toll on the browser because it needs to repaint the screen almost
      completely and often, so we need to handle the processing triggered by the
      scroll (if we have any) carefully (and asynchronously).
