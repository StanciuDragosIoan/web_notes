    <h1 class="header">The Linux Desktop Environment</h1>
    <p class="text">
      A Desktop environment is a graphical tool that displays icons and menus on
      the screen. It controls the appearance and provides programs/utilities
      that help with common tasks like file management
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Among the most prominent environments we find: Unity, GNOME, KDE, Xfce
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Nautilus is the main file explorer in linux (default file explorer -
      cabinet icon).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      In the home directory we have only user related elements (NO system
      elements).
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
      /home
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      In 'other locations' we can see the root directory of the system. In
      'computer' we find everything on the pc. In 'other locations' we also have
      the 'network' button to connect to networks
    </p>

    <h1 class="header">Getting familiar with the command line</h1>
    <p class="text">
      A lot of functionality in linux can be done through the GUI, but power
      users preffer the command line to perform the tasks more quickly and more
      efficiently. Everything in the GUI can be done through the command line.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The command line will offer more options/ways to execute a program.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      We can put multiple programs in a shell script (a file containing multiple
      intructions that get executed 1 after another), and this is a good way to
      automate tasks.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      We can open a terminal from the system or connect remotely with a client
      like Putty.
    </p>
    <p class="text">some basic commands:</p>
    <p class="text">
      <span class="snippet">ls</span> (displays the contents of the current
      directory)
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      <span class="snippet">ls /var</span> (displays the contents of the
      <span class="snippet">var</span>
      directory)
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      <span class="snippet">pwd</span> (print working directory-prints the path
      to the current directory)
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      <span class="snippet">cd ..</span> (move to parent directory)
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      <span class="snippet">cd ../.. </span> (move 2 directories up)
    </p>
