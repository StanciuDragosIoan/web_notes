    <h1 class="header">The Linux Desktop Environment</h1>
    <p class="text">
      A Desktop environment is a graphical tool that displays icons and menus on
      the screen. It controls the appearance and provides programs/utilities
      that help with common tasks like file management
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Among the most prominent environments we find: Unity, GNOME, KDE, Xfce
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Nautilus is the main file explorer in linux (default file explorer -
      cabinet icon).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      In the home directory we have only user related elements (NO system
      elements).
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
      /home
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      In 'other locations' we can see the root directory of the system. In
      'computer' we find everything on the pc. In 'other locations' we also have
      the 'network' button to connect to networks
    </p>

    <h1 class="header">Getting familiar with the command line</h1>
    <p class="text">
      A lot of functionality in linux can be done through the GUI, but power
      users preffer the command line to perform the tasks more quickly and more
      efficiently. Everything in the GUI can be done through the command line.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The command line will offer more options/ways to execute a program.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      We can put multiple programs in a shell script (a file containing multiple
      intructions that get executed 1 after another), and this is a good way to
      automate tasks.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      We can open a terminal from the system or connect remotely with a client
      like Putty.
    </p>
    <p class="text">some basic commands:</p>
    <p class="text">
      <span class="snippet">ls</span> (displays the contents of the current
      directory)
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      <span class="snippet">ls /var</span> (displays the contents of the
      <span class="snippet">var</span>
      directory)
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      <span class="snippet">pwd</span> (print working directory-prints the path
      to the current directory)
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      <span class="snippet">cd ..</span> (move to parent directory)
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      <span class="snippet">cd ../.. </span> (move 2 directories up)
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      If we want to launch a program such as the firefox browser, we can do:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
      /usr/bin/firefox
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      We can also simply type <span class="snippet">firefox</span> in the
      terminal.
    </p>
    <p class="text bold center">
      the $PATH variable in Linux
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The <span class="snippet">firefox</span> command above works because of
      the path variable. The path variable contains the locations in which the
      system will look when we type a command that is not in its full path.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      When we type <span class="snippet">firefox</span> the browser starts up
      because the location where firefox is installed is in the $PATH variable
      (in <span class="snippet">/usr/bin </span>).
    </p>
    <p class="text">In order to see the full path variable type:</p>
    <pre class="code">
      echo $PATH
    </pre>
    <p class="text">This will display the full $PATH variable:</p>
    <pre class="code">
      /home/amaimon/.deno/bin:/home/amaimon/.cargo/bin:
      /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:
      /sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      The directories in the $PATH variable are separated by semicolons. Note
      that in the variable above, the
      <span class="snippet">/usr/bin </span> directory is included (that's where
      firefox is installed and that's how the system knows to start up the
      browser when we use only the
      <span class="snippet">firefox</span> command).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The system will look for the directories in the $PATH variable in the
      following order:
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      first will look in <span class="snippet">usr/local/sbin</span>, next in
      <span class="snippet">usr/local/bin</span>, next
      <span class="snippet">usr/sbin</span>, then in
      <span class="snippet">usr/bin</span> , etc... so for instance having 2
      programs installed with the same name in 2 different locations in the
      $PATH, the first one will run first.
    </p>
    <p class="title text center">Bash Scripting</p>
    <p class="text">
      In a linux distribution we can create scripts that can automate tasks for
      us (can run programs and perform various actions). We will create a simple
      one for testing purposes.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Create a test.sh file in the current directory. Open the file in a text
      editor and type in it:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
      echo 'Hello from Ubuntu =)!';
    </pre>
    <p class="text">Save the file, and run it by typing in the terminal:</p>
    <pre class="code">
      ./test.sh
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      the <span class="snippet">./</span> makes it so that the terminal instance
      runs the program from the current directory (where the test.sh script is
      located). If <span class="snippet">test.sh</span> were in a different
      folder, we would have to type the full path to it. The output of the
      command above will be:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
      Hello from Ubuntu =)!
    </pre>
    <p class="text center bold">The filesystem tree in Linux</p>
    <p class="text">
      The base directory is called root <span class="snippet">/</span>
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Under the root <span class="snippet">/</span> directory there are
      directories like: home <span class="snippet">/home</span>, var
      <span class="snippet">/var</span>, media
      <span class="snippet">/media</span>, etc...
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Under these there are the users directories home/dragos
      <span class="snippet">home/dragos</span>, the logs
      <span class="snippet">home/log</span>, etc...
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      A typical linux filesystem tree looks like this (not all directories
      included):
