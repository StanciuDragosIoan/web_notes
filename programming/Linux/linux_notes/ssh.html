    <h1 class="header">SSH</h1>
    <p class="text">
      SSH (Secure Shell) is a secure communication protocol (like http, https,
      ftp) used as the primary means of connecting to Linux servers remotely. It
      provides a text-based interface by spawning a remote shell. After
      connecting, all commands you type in your local terminal are sent to the
      remote server and executed there.We can use SSH for anything (create
      files/folders, install/run programs, deploying applications, setting up
      web servers).When you connect through SSH, you log in using an account
      that exists on the remote server.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">
      How SSH Works
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      When you connect through SSH, you will be dropped into a shell session,
      which is a text-based interface where you can interact with your server.
      For the duration of your SSH session, any commands that you type into your
      local terminal are sent through an encrypted SSH tunnel and executed on
      your server.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The SSH connection is implemented using a client-server model. This means
      that for an SSH connection to be established, the remote machine must be
      running a piece of software called an SSH daemon. This software listens
      for connections on a specific network port, authenticates connection
      requests, and spawns the appropriate environment if the user provides the
      correct credentials.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The user’s computer must have an SSH client. This is a piece of software
      that knows how to communicate using the SSH protocol and can be given
      information about the remote host to connect to, the username to use, and
      the credentials that should be passed to authenticate. The client can also
      specify certain details about the connection type they would like to
      establish.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">
      How SSH Authenticates Users
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Clients generally authenticate either using passwords (less secure and not
      recommended) or SSH keys, which are very secure.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Password logins are encrypted and are easy to understand for new users.
      However, automated bots and malicious users will often repeatedly try to
      authenticate to accounts that allow password-based logins, which can lead
      to security compromises. For this reason, it is recommended to always set
      up SSH key-based authentication for most configurations.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      SSH keys are a matching set of cryptographic keys which can be used for
      authentication. Each set contains a public and a private key. The public
      key can be shared freely without concern, while the private key must be
      vigilantly guarded and never exposed to anyone.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      To authenticate using SSH keys, a user must have an
      <span class="snippet">SSH key pair</span> on their local computer. On the
      remote server, the <span class="snippet">public key</span> must be copied
      to a file within the user’s home directory at
      <span class="snippet">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</span> . This file contains a
      list of public keys, one-per-line, that are authorized to log into this
      account.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      When a client connects to the host, wishing to use SSH key authentication,
      it will inform the server of this intent and will tell the server which
      <span class="snippet">public key</span> to use. The server then checks its
      <span class="snippet">authorized_keys</span> file for the
      <span class="snippet">public key</span> , generates a random string and
      encrypts it using the <span class="snippet">public key</span> . This
      encrypted message can only be decrypted with the associated
      <span class="snippet">private key</span> . The server will send this
      encrypted message to the client to test whether they actually have the
      associated <span class="snippet">private key</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Upon receipt of this message, the client will decrypt it using the
      <span class="snippet">private key</span> and combine the random string
      that is revealed with a previously negotiated
      <span class="snippet">session ID</span>. It then generates an
      <span class="snippet">MD5</span> hash of this value and transmits it back
      to the server. The server already had the original message and the session
      ID, so it can compare an <span class="snippet">MD5</span> hash generated
      by those values and determine that the client must have the
      <span class="snippet">private key</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">
      Generating SSH Key pair
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Generating a new SSH public and private key pair on your local computer is
      the first step towards authenticating with a remote server without a
      password.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      A number of cryptographic algorithms can be used to generate SSH keys,
      including <span class="snippet">RSA</span>,
      <span class="snippet">DSA</span>, and <span class="snippet">ECDSSA</span>.
      <span class="snippet">RSA</span>keys are generally preferred and are the
      default key type.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      To generate an RSA key pair on your local computer, type:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
      ssh-keygen
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      After running the command, you will get prompted to choose the path for
      the key to be stored:
    </p>
    <div class="devPic">
      <img src="./img/ssh_path.png" alt="" />
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      This prompt allows you to choose the location to store your RSA private
      key. Press ENTER to leave this as the default, which will store them in
      the <span class="snippet">/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Leaving the default location selected will allow your SSH client to find
      the keys automatically.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The next prompt allows you to enter a
      <span class="snippet">passphrase</span> of an arbitrary length to secure
      your <span class="snippet">private key</span>. By default, you will have
      to enter any <span class="snippet">passphrase</span> you set here every
      time you use the <span class="snippet">private key</span> , as an
      additional security measure. Feel free to press ENTER to leave this blank
      if you do not want a <span class="snippet">passphrase</span>. Keep in mind
      though that this will allow anyone who gains control of your
      <span class="snippet">private key</span>
      to login to your servers:
    </p>
    <div class="devPic">
      <img src="./img/ssh_passphrase.png" alt="" />
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      If you choose to enter a <span class="snippet">passphrase</span>, nothing
      will be displayed as you type. This is a security precaution.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Once finished with the passphrase, the
      <span class="snippet">RSA SSH Key Pair</span> will be generated in the
      <span class="snippet">.ssh</span> directory:
    </p>
    <div class="devPic">
      <img src="./img/ssh_keypair.png" alt="" />
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      The <span class="snippet">private key</span> is located in
      <span class="snippet">~/username/.ssh</span> and it is called
      <span class="snippet">id_rsa</span>. This key must never be shared with
      anyone.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The associated <span class="snippet">public key</span> is called
      <span class="snippet">id_rsa.pub</span> and it is also located in
      <span class="snippet">~/username/.ssh</span>. This key can be shared
      freely and it is the one that we copy onto the remote server on which we
      want to authenticate with SSH.
    </p>
    <!-- <p class="text bold center">SSH Client/Server Communication</p>
    <p class="text">
      In order for us to log onto a machine with SSH the credentials are not
      enough, the machine must also have the SSHD (Open SSH Daemon) installed
      and running. The daemon listens for SSH connections.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The server must have SSHD installed and running or we will not be able to
      connect to it using SSH.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      On the server we have an sshd configuration file (where we can change
      configuration such as disabling password login for the root user).
    </p>
    <p class="text bold center">SSH Authentication Methods</p>
    <p class="text">
      Password (default way of authentication). In order to authenticate we use
      the following command:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
      ssh user@192.168.1.29 //can use domain or IP address
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      Once we do that, it will prompt us for a password (if we do not have SSH
      keys set up).
    </p>
    <p class="text bold center">Public/Private Key Pair (recommended way)</p>
    <p class="text">
      Same command as above to log in and the program will let us in without
      asking for a password.
    </p>
    <p class="center text bold">Host Based</p>
    <p class="text">
      Via a known hosts file which allows certain hosts to connect to a machine.
    </p>
    <p class="center bold text">Generating Keys</p>
    <p class="text">The command for generating keys is:</p>
    <pre class="code">
      ssh-keygen
    </pre>
    <p class="text">This command will create a public key and a private one.</p>
    <p class="text">
      The keys will be created by default in the home directory in a hidden
      folder (.ssh). The command will prompt you to choose a different name
      other than id_rsa for the keys, but this is the default.
    </p>
    <p class="text"><span class="snippet">~/.ssh/id_rsa</span> (Private Key)</p>
    <p class="text">
      <span class="snippet">~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</span> (Public Key)
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The public key goes on the server. On the server we will also have a
      <span class="snippet"> .ssh</span> folder (or will create one if it does
      not exist), and in that directory we'll have a file called
      <span class="snippet">authorized_keys</span> (this is where the public key
      will be put).This is how the server knows if the machine we are using to
      log onto it is authorized to do so.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Windows did not support unix ssh until recently. Now it does. In older
      versions of windows we can use a program called Putty.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Git Bash and other unix-like wrappers for the terminal include the ssh
      command & other Unix tools.
