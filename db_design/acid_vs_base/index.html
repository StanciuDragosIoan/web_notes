  <h1 class="header">ACID vs BASE</h1>

  <p class="text">
    Deciding on the right database management system <span class="snippet">(DBMS) </span> can be a difficult task. The
    number of available options is
    huge. Before you start searching for an adequate database solution, consider your requirements.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    A recommended first step in this process is to choose a <span class="snippet">database transaction model</span>.
    This is a set of rules which
    determine how a database organizes, stores, and manipulates data.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    <span class="snippet">ACID</span> and <span class="snippet">BASE</span> are two of the most popular transactional
    models.
  </p>
  <p class="text center bold">
    <span class="snippet">ACID</span> vs <span class="snippet">BASE</span>
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    The <span class="snippet">CAP</span> theorem states that it is impossible to achieve both consistency and
    availability in a partition tolerant
    distributed system (i.e., a system which continues to work in cases of temporary communication breakdowns).
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    * the <span class="snippet">CAP</span> theoreme comes from <span class="snippet">Consistency, Availability and
      Partition tolerance (the system keeps operating even if some messages are delayed)</span>.
  </p>
  <p class="text">The fundamental difference between <span class="snippet">ACID</span> and <span
      class="snippet">BASE</span> database models is the way they deal with limitation.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    The <span class="snippet">ACID</span> model provides a consistent system.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    The <span class="snippet">BASE</span> model provides a high availability.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    To provide further insight, we will discuss each of the models separately and then compare them.
  </p>
  <p class="text center bold">
    ACID model
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    The <span class="snippet">ACID</span> database transaction model ensures that a performed transaction is always
    consistent. This makes it a good fit for businesses which deal with online transaction processing (e.g. financial
    institutions) or online analyticl processing (e.g. data warehousing). These organizations need database systems
    which can handle many small simultaneous transactions. There must be 0 tolerance for invalid state.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    To better explain the <span class="snippet">ACID</span> model, it's best to start by breaking apart the acronym in
    its name.
  </p>
  <div class="devPic">
    <img src="./img/acid-acronym.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <p class="text">
    <span class="snippet">ACID</span> stands for
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    <span class="snippet">Atomic</span> - Each transaction is either properly carried out or the
    process halts and the database reverts back to the state before the transaction started. This ensures that all data
    in the database is valid.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    <span class="snippet">Consistent</span> - A processed transaction will never endanger the structural integrity of
    the database.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    <span class="snippet">Isolated</span> - Transactions cannot compromise the integrity of other transactions by
    interacting with them while they are still in progress.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    <span class="snippet">Durable</span> - The data related to the completed transaction will persist even in the cases
    of network or power outages. If a transaction fails, it will not impact the manipulated data.
  </p>
  <p class="text center bold">
    ACID Use Case Example
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Financial institutions will almost exclusively use <span class="snippet">ACID</span> databases. Money transfers
    depend on the atomic nature of
    <span class="snippet">ACID</span>.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    An interrupted transaction which is not immediately removed from the database can cause a lot of issues. Money could
    be debited from one account and, due to an error, never credited to another.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Which Databases are actually <span class="snippet">ACID</span> compliant?
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    One safe way to make sure your database is <span class="snippet">ACID</span> compliant is to choose a relational
    database management system.
    These include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Some <span class="snippet">NoSQL DBMSs</span>, such as <strong>Apache’s CouchDB or IBM’s Db2</strong> , also possess
    a certain degree
    of <span class="snippet">ACID</span> compliance. However,
    the philosophy behind the <span class="snippet">NoSQL</span> approach to database management goes against the strict
    <span class="snippet">ACID</span> rules. Hence, <span class="snippet">NoSQL</span>
    databases are not the recommended choice for those who need strict environments.
  </p>
  <p class="text center bold">
    BASE model
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    The rise of <span class="snippet">NoSQL</span> databases provided a flexible and fluid way to manipulate data. As a
    result, a new database model
    was designed, reflecting these properties.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    The acronym <span class="snippet">BASE</span> is slightly more confusing than <span class="snippet">ACID</span>.
    However, the words behind it
    suggest ways in which the <span class="snippet">BASE</span>
    model is different.
  </p>
  <div class="devPic">
    <img src="./img/base-acronym.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <p class="text">
    <span class="snippet">BASE</span> stands for:
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    <span class="snippet">Basically Available</span> - Rather than enforcing immediate consistency, BASE-modelled NoSQL
    databases will ensure availability of data by spreading and replicating it across the nodes of the database cluster.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    <span class="snippet">Soft State </span> - Due to the lack of immediate consistency, data values may change over
    time. The BASE model breaks off with the concept of a database which enforces its own consistency, delegating that
    responsibility to developers
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    <span class="snippet">
      Eventually Consistent - he fact that <span class="snippet">BASE</span> does not enforce immediate consistency does
      not mean that it never
      achieves it. However, until it does, data reads are still possible (even though they might not reflect the
      reality)
    </span>
  </p>
  <p class="text center bold">
    BASE Use Case Example
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Marketing and customer service companies who deal with sentiment analysis will prefer the elasticity of <span
      class="snippet">BASE</span> when
    conducting their social network research. Social network feeds are not well structured but contain huge amounts of
    data which a <span class="snippet">BASE</span>-modeled database can easily store.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Which Databases are Using the <span class="snippet">BASE</span> Model?
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Just as <strong>SQL</strong> databases are almost uniformly <span class="snippet">ACID</span> compliant,
    <strong>NoSQL</strong>
    databases tend to conform to <span class="snippet">BASE</span>
    principles.
    <strong> MongoDB, Cassandra and Redis </strong> are among the most popular <strong>NoSQL</strong> solutions,
    together with <strong> Amazon
      DynamoDB and
      Couchbase</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="text center bold">
    <span class="snippet">ACID</span> vs. <span class="snippet">BASE</span>: Which One is Good for You?
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    It is not possible to give a straight answer to the question of which database model is better. Therefore, a
    decision must be reached by considering all the aspects of the project.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Given their highly structured nature, <span class="snippet">ACID</span>-compliant databases will be a better fit for
    those who require
    consistency, predictability, and reliability.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Those who consider growth to be among their priorities will likely want to choose the <span
      class="snippet">BASE</span> model, because it enables
    easier scaling up and provides more flexibility. However, <span class="snippet">BASE</span> also requires developers
    who will know how to deal
    with the limitations of the model.
